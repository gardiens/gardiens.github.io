## Abstract

In Deep Learning, automatic
image classification can suffer from
unstructured labels and loss functions.We Introduce semantic knowledge
in data labels, via a custom
tree-based loss, could reduce
critical misclassifications.
Our goal is to assess if this new
model-agnostic method performs
better than existing solutions on the
CIFAR-10 dataset.
